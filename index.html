    <h1 class="center">welcome to the hodgepodge enneagram test</h1>
    <h4 class="center">(where i threw together bits and pieces of existing tests in an amateur attempt to make a more accurate one after many inaccurate diagnoses)</h4><br>
    <h2>What is the Enneagram?</h2>
    <h3>The Enneagram is a tool with roots that go way back. It’s not too clear, but it most likely stemmed from Evagrius, the monk who had an influence on labelling the “seven deadly sins”. It’s a “personality”
    system with nine types that helps identify your basic fears and desires, and the ways that it affects your
    relationship with yourself, the people around you, and God.</h3>
    <br>
    <h2>How is this personality test any different? Why does this matter?</h2>
    <h3>Something that I think differentiates the Enneagram from other frameworks is its undeniable effect in 
    identifying and conquering sin (Christian lingo that can be simplified to “what we think, say, or do that
    separates us from God, people, and even ourselves”). It doesn’t merely describe our tendencies, but it
    also points out our imperfections and raises questions that need an answer. As a Christian, this answer
    is the Gospel, and the Enneagram is most effectively used when viewing from this perspective. It does not
    claim to be your savior; instead, it provides a clearer understanding of sanctification. On top of that, 
    it is a powerful tool that promotes compassion and empathy. I often ask my friends to take this in order to 
    better understand them.</h3>
    <br>
    <h3><b>Therefore</b>, like all personality tests, I should all the more caution against slipping into the mindset of “this is just who I am” or letting your
    number “identify you.” We weren’t created by rolling a nine-sided die. This is just another tool that only 
    reveals a simple glimpse of what already goes on in our complex hearts.

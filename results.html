You can look into which wing you are: <a id="ltypelink" target="_blank" href=""><b><span class="rType"></span>w<span class="rTypeL"></span></b></a> or <a id="utypelink" target="_blank" href=""><b><span class="rType"></span>w<span class="rTypeH"></span></b></a>. However, don’t stop here! Take some more time to self-reflect and explore to see if this is accurate.</h1>

                    Remember, the purpose of "shoving you into a box" is to get you out of it. I’d recommend looking into basic <b>Fears and Desires</b>,
                    <b>Healthy vs Unhealthy levels</b>, <b>Growth and Stress arrows</b>, and <b>Type Centers</b> (Body, Emotion, Intelligence).<br><br>

                    No two people of the same type will ever look exactly the same, and no one will ever truly 100% resonate with a type. Why? 
                    Because again, this is merely a tool that illuminates what’s already inside. You probably even resonate with all the types (hint: read up 
                    on all of them!). By providing a generic snapshot, it also helps others understand you from another perspective.<br><br>

                    And if you <b>are</b> a Type <span class="rType"></span>, remember this... <br><span class="verse"></span> (Source: Saturate the World)<br><br>

                    And as a departing gift, here is a song from my favorite artist, Sleeping At Last, written just for you.<br><br>
